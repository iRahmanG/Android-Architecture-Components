# 📚 Android Architecture Components – Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repo where I’m following a structured **Android Development Summer Roadmap**. This repo includes mini-projects, concept demos, and practical apps built using **Java** and **MVVM Architecture**, along with Jetpack components like LiveData, ViewModel, and Room.

## Note
The projects which have made during my learning while commiting into this repo they got corrupted and so in this repo the projucts does not have source code.
